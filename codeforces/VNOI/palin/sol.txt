Approach the problem as follows : First convert the number to a palindrome. Then if needed incrementally 
increase the number to get a larger palindrome.
Input : 87654
Now to make this number a palindrome, let's copy the first half into the second half.
New number : 87678.
Now this number is the next largest palindrome of 87654.
In this case all the numbers in the first half were greater than the numbers in the second half, so no more 
processing was required.
Now take the case of number : 1234.
To make this number palindrome again copy the first half into the second half.
New number : 1221.
Now this is less than our original number. The trick here is that, to get the next largest palindrome, we 
incrementally increase the number starting from the middle and propagate to the beginning and end respectively
until we get a number larger than the original. Since we want the next largest, we simply add 1.
Doing so , gives us : 1331, which is the next palindrome.
We do however have a special case here if the middle digit(s) is 9, in which case we replace the 9 with 0 and
carry 1 for the rest of the digits until we either reach a digit which is less than 9 or we reach the 
beginning/end.
If we reach a digit which is less than 9 , we add 1 to it and its mirror digit.(as we converted the number to a 
palindrome)
For example : 19995->19991->20002
If we reach the beginning/end.(which means that all the digits were 9 ) , we append 1 to the beginning and make 
the last digit also 1.
9999->10000->10001.
